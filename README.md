## Local Preview

To run the site locally for preview:

1. Ensure you have a recent Ruby installed (e.g., via Homebrew: `brew install ruby`) and that the Homebrew Ruby is on your `PATH`.
2. Install dependencies from the project root:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
3. Start the Jekyll development server with live reload:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
   ```
4. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` (or the host/port shown in the terminal) to preview the blog. The server will rebuild automatically when files change.
5. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server when you are done.
